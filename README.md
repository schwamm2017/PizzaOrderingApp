# PizzaOrderingApp

/*About the project*/

The front end application is able to allow users to input data, select pizza toppings, and change the quantity of selected toppings. It can display order details summary as well
Developed this front-end application from 22nd January to 27th January, 2019. I code 8 hours per day in consecutive 4 days

Use React/JSX, ES6 to render application home page

Use Webpack and Webpack-dev-server to improve development speed

Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to optimize layout

Coded in declarative programming rather than imperative programming

/*attached in this repository, there is an .gif file to show the basic function of the front-ended app*/
